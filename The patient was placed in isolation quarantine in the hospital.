On Friday February 14, the Egyptian Ministry of Health announced the first confirmed case of the new Corona virus in Africa.

The ministry said in a statement that the victim was not an Egyptian without specifying nationality.

"The ministry has taken preventative measures and is monitoring the patient ... who is stable," said Khaled Mujahid, a spokesman for the Ministry of Health.

Egyptian authorities notified the World Health Organization and the patient was quarantined in the hospital.

The death toll of the epidemic has approached 1,400 cases, almost exclusively in China, where it has been recognized for the first time.

Deep trade links with China and often overburdened health systems have raised concerns about African countries' ability to respond to the outbreak.

Earlier this month, Egypt suspended all of its domestic airline's flights to China. And they will continue to be punished until the end of the month.

Three hundred Egyptians were evacuated from Wuhan, the virus center in China, and detained for 14 days.
